# classification-challenge
This project utilized two supervised machine learning classification models - a logistic regression model and a random forest model - to evaluate a large dataset containing data about emails. The models were created to classify if emails were 1) spam or 2) not spam. The two models were evaluated to determine which was more accurate at detecting spam. Both performed well, but the random forest model yielded the highest accuracy score.
