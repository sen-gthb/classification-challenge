**M13 Classification Challenge:**
This project examines a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. Two classification models are utilized - a logistic regression model and a random forest model - to evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam.


(**Spoiler Alert!:** they both performed well, but the random forest model yielded the highest accuracy score)
